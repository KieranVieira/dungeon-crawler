<!--
      Example HTML page that will function as a "room". I wanted you to
      have the freedom to build as you see fit, so you can just create a room
      and add it to the "rooms" folder which contains all the HTML files
      we will use for the dungeon crawler

      The Media folder just holds any pictures or other images anyone might
      want to incorporate
